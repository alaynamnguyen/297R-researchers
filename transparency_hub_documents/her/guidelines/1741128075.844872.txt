HER Community Guidelines
Our Values
At HER, we aim to create a secure space for Sapphics (queer women, intersex, ace, trans and non-binary folks) to unapologetically be themselves, connect, and build relationships rooted in trust, identity, and community.
Safety:
Everyone deserves to feel safe in their interactions.
Respect:
Respectful, open-minded discussions help us connect and grow.
Inclusivity:
HER is a space for LGBTQ+ women, trans, non-binary, and gender non-conforming individuals.
What We Love to See
Supportive Engagement:
Embrace fun and humor, listen to different perspectives, and keep interactions drama-free. If something unintentionally hurts you, kindly name it; this can foster understanding and strengthen our community.
Inclusivity in Action:
Diverse voices make us stronger. Encourage and value each other, respond to comments, and engage in thoughtful conversations.
Respecting Community Boundaries:
HER is a unique space for sapphic-identifying individuals. We expect community members to honor this by respecting others’ identities and experiences.

Community rules
Any post or profile is at liberty to be removed by HER staff or HER moderators if they do not comply with the community rules.
Threesomes
We do not allow “unicorn hunting” on HER. Why not?
Objectification: Unicorn hunters often treat the “unicorn” as an object to fulfil their fantasies rather than as an individual with their own desires, emotions, and boundaries.
Devaluation of bisexuality: This practice perpetuates stereotypes that bisexual people are promiscuous or “up for anything.” It undermines the legitimacy of their identities and relationships.
Power imbalance: The pre-existing couple often holds a higher status in the relationship, with the “unicorn” expected to conform to their rules and expectations. This can lead to unequal dynamics and a lack of agency for the third party.
Emotional harm: Unicorns may feel pressure to please both partners, leading to emotional stress and potential harm. Additionally, couples may not fully consider the emotional needs of the third party, causing them to feel used or unimportant.
Exclusion from the community: Unicorn hunting can make LGBTQ+ spaces feel unwelcoming to bisexual or queer individuals who are targeted or objectified, hindering their ability to build genuine connections and find support.
Lack of respect for consent and boundaries: In some cases, unicorn hunters may disregard the boundaries, preferences, and consent of the person they are pursuing, leading to uncomfortable or harmful situations.
We know plenty of unicorns actively consent to unicorning for a night, but this is not the right platform to look for them
.
Chasers
We do not allow trans chasers on HER. When chasers enter the chat, we see reports of:
Objectification: Trans chasers often fetishize and objectify transgender people, which can make them feel dehumanized and devalued as individuals.
Lack of genuine interest: Trans chasers may be more interested in fulfilling their own fantasies than in forming genuine connections with transgender people, leading to superficial or one-sided relationships.
Disregard for boundaries and consent: Trans chasers may not respect the personal boundaries, comfort levels, and consent of transgender individuals, which can lead to uncomfortable or harmful situations.
Emotional distress: Encounters with trans chasers can cause emotional stress and anxiety for transgender individuals, who may feel used, exploited, or invalidated.
Erosion of trust: Transgender people may become wary of potential partners or feel unable to trust others in dating environments, as they may be concerned about encountering trans chasers.
Undermining identity: Trans chasers may reduce transgender people to their transgender status, undermining the complexity and legitimacy of their identities.
Infringement of safe spaces: The presence of trans chasers in FLINTA spaces can make these environments feel less safe, supportive, and inclusive for transgender individuals seeking community and connections.
Moderators
Our lovely moderators, easily identified by a black M on their profiles, are dedicated community members who generously volunteer their time to help maintain a safe, inclusive, and nurturing space for all. They can’t keep an eye on every comment or post, but they put their hearts into removing content and users that don’t align with our community guidelines. Remember, we’re all in this together to keep our community safe and sound.

By working together and looking out for each other, we can ensure our community stays safe and welcoming.
