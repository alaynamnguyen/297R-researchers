Our mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy.We have Community Guidelines to create a welcoming, safe, and entertaining experience. The guidelines apply to everyone and everything on our platform. They include rules for what is allowed on TikTok, as well as standards for what is eligible for the For You feed (FYF). To address new risks and harms, the guidelines are updated on an ongoing basis.To help you read through the guidelines, we organize them by topic area, and highlight each rule in bold. Under each section you can click More information for definitions, examples, and clarifications to common questions. The examples do not cover everything (we are telling you this now so that you do not have to repeatedly read the phrase "including, but not limited to"). If you are ever in doubt about what to share, please remember to be kind and treat others the way that you would want to be treated.Thank you for helping to keep TikTok a welcoming space for everyone!Content ModerationKeeping our platform safe, trustworthy, and vibrant requires balancing creative expression and preventing harm. We use a combination of safety approaches to strike the right balance:Remove content that we do not allowEveryone who joins TikTok has the ability to freely share content on the platform. However, we remove content--whether posted publicly or privately--when we find that it violates our rules.Restrict content that is not suitable for youthWe allow a range of content on our platform, but also recognize that not all of it may be suitable for younger audiences. We restrict content that may not be suitable so that it is only viewed by adults (18 years and older). A summary of restricted content categories can be found here.Make ineligible for the FYF content that does not meet our recommendation standardsThe FYF is an opportunity to discover new content and reach new audiences, but it is not guaranteed that all content will be recommended. Content that does not meet our standards will be ineligible for the FYF. A summary of these standards can be found here.Empower our community with information, tools, and resourcesWe want to make sure you have the right information to help you manage your experience on TikTok. We may add labels, "opt-in" screens, or warnings to provide more context. Our safety toolkit can help you to filter out content with specific hashtags or comments that you are not comfortable seeing, and we also offer account controls and in-app features with safety resources.CompanyAbout TikTokTikTok BrowseNewsroomContactCareersByteDanceProgramsTikTok for GoodTikTok EmbedsEffect HouseTikTok for DevelopersAdvertise on TikTokTikTok RewardsResourcesHelp CenterSafety CenterCreator AcademyCommunity GuidelinesTransparencyAccessibilityLegalCookies PolicyPrivacy Policy for Younger UsersIntellectual Property PolicyLaw EnforcementPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceEnglishBahasa IndonesiaDeutschEnglishEspaÃ±olFranÃ§ais (France)ItalianoPolskiPortuguÃªsTiáº¿ng Viá»tTÃ¼rkÃ§eÐ ÑÑÑÐºÐ¸Ð¹íêµ­ì´æ¥æ¬èªç¹é«ä¸­æØ§ÙØ¹Ø±Ø¨ÙØ©Ø§Ø±Ø¯ÙBahasa MelayuÄeÅ¡tinaFilipinoMagyarNederlandsRomÃ¢nÄSvenskaÎÎ»Î»Î·Î½Î¹ÎºÎ¬Ð£ÐºÑÐ°ÑÐ½ÑÑÐºÐ°à¦¬à¦¾à¦à¦²à¦¾à¸ à¸²à¸©à¸²à¹à¸à¸¢áá¼ááºáá¬áá¬áá¬áá¶áá¶áááááSuomieesti keelÐ±ÑÐ»Ð³Ð°ÑÑÐºÐ¸ ÐµÐ·Ð¸Ðºhrvatski jezikLatvieÅ¡u valodaàºàº²àºªàº²àº¥àº²àº§danskEspaÃ±ol (AmÃ©rica Latina)OÊ»zbeklietuviÅ³ kalbaslovenÄinanorsk bokmÃ¥lÒÐ°Ð·Ð°ÒÑÐ°ShqipGaeilgeÃslenskaSlovenÅ¡Äina×¢××¨××ªà¤¹à¤¿à¤à¤¦à¥Bahasa IndonesiaDeutschEnglishEspaÃ±olFranÃ§ais (France)ItalianoPolskiPortuguÃªsTiáº¿ng Viá»tTÃ¼rkÃ§eÐ ÑÑÑÐºÐ¸Ð¹íêµ­ì´æ¥æ¬èªç¹é«ä¸­æØ§ÙØ¹Ø±Ø¨ÙØ©Ø§Ø±Ø¯ÙBahasa MelayuÄeÅ¡tinaFilipinoMagyarNederlandsRomÃ¢nÄSvenskaÎÎ»Î»Î·Î½Î¹ÎºÎ¬Ð£ÐºÑÐ°ÑÐ½ÑÑÐºÐ°à¦¬à¦¾à¦à¦²à¦¾à¸ à¸²à¸©à¸²à¹à¸à¸¢áá¼ááºáá¬áá¬áá¬áá¶áá¶áááááSuomieesti keelÐ±ÑÐ»Ð³Ð°ÑÑÐºÐ¸ ÐµÐ·Ð¸Ðºhrvatski jezikLatvieÅ¡u valodaàºàº²àºªàº²àº¥àº²àº§danskEspaÃ±ol (AmÃ©rica Latina)OÊ»zbeklietuviÅ³ kalbaslovenÄinanorsk bokmÃ¥lÒÐ°Ð·Ð°ÒÑÐ°ShqipGaeilgeÃslenskaSlovenÅ¡Äina×¢××¨××ªà¤¹à¤¿à¤à¤¦à¥Â©2025 TikTok
