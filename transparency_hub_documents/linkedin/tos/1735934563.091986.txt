You agree that we will provide notices and messages to you in the following ways: (1) within the Services or (2) sent to the contact information you provided us (e.g., email, mobile number, physical address). You agree to keep your contact information up to date.
Please review your settings to control and limit messages you receive from us.2.5 Sharing







When you share information on our Services, others can see, copy and use that information.

 



Our Services allow sharing of information (including content) in many ways, such as through your profile, posts, articles, group posts, links to news articles, job postings, messages, and InMails. Depending on the feature and choices you make, information that you share may be seen by other Members, Visitors, or others (on or off of the Services). Where we have made settings available, we will honor the choices you make about who can see content or other information (e.g., message content to your addressees, sharing content only to LinkedIn connections, restricting your profile visibility from search tools, or opting not to notify others of your LinkedIn profile update). For job searching activities, we default to not notifying your connections or the public. So, if you apply for a job through our Services or opt to signal that you are interested in a job, our default is to share it only with the job poster.
To the extent that laws allow this, we are not obligated to publish any content or other information on our Services and can remove it with or without notice.






3. Rights and Limits3.1. Your License to LinkedIn






 
You own all of your original content that you provide to us, but you also grant us a non-exclusive license to it.

 





 
We’ll honor the choices you make about who gets to see your content, including how it can be used for ads.

 



As between you and LinkedIn, you own your original content that you submit or post to the Services. 
You grant LinkedIn and our affiliates the following non-exclusive license to the content and other information you provide (e.g., share, post, upload, and/or otherwise submit) to our Services:
A worldwide, transferable and sublicensable right to use, copy, modify, distribute, publicly perform and display, host, and process your content and other information without any further consent, notice and/or compensation to you or others. These rights are limited in the following ways:You can end this license for specific content by deleting such content from the Services, or generally by closing your account, except (a) to the extent you (1) shared it with others as part of the Services and they copied, re-shared it or stored it, (2) we had already sublicensed others prior to your content removal or closing of your account, or (3) we are required by law to retain or share it with others, and (b) for the reasonable time it takes to remove from backup and other systems.We will not include your content in advertisements for the products and services of third parties to others without your separate consent (including sponsored content). However, without compensation to you or others, ads may be served near your content and other information, and your social actions may be visible and included with ads, as noted in the Privacy Policy. If you use a Service feature, we may mention that with your name or photo to promote that feature within our Services, subject to your settings.We will honor the audience choices for shared content (e.g., “Connections only”). For example, if you choose to share your post to "Anyone on or off LinkedIn” (or similar): (a) we may make it available off LinkedIn; (b) we may enable others to publicly share onto third-party services (e.g., a Member embedding your post on a third party service); and/or (c) we may enable search tools to make that public content findable though their services. Learn MoreWhile we may edit and make format changes to your content (such as translating or transcribing it, modifying the size, layout or file type, and removing or adding labels or metadata), we will take steps to avoid materially modifying the meaning of your expression in content you share with others. Because you own your original content and we only have non-exclusive rights to it, you may choose to make it available to others, including under the terms of a Creative Commons license.








You and LinkedIn agree that if content includes personal data, it is subject to our Privacy Policy.

 



You and LinkedIn agree that we may access, store, process, and use any information (including content and/or personal data) that you provide in accordance with the terms of the Privacy Policy and your choices (including settings).By submitting suggestions or other feedback regarding our Services to LinkedIn, you agree that LinkedIn can use and share (but does not have to) such feedback for any purpose without compensation to you.






 
You promise to only provide content and other information that you have the right to share and that your LinkedIn profile will be truthful.

 



You agree to only provide content and other information that does not violate the law or anyone’s rights (including intellectual property rights). You have choices about how much information to provide on your profile but also agree that the profile information you provide will be truthful. LinkedIn may be required by law to remove certain content and other information in certain countries.3.2 Service Availability






 
We may change or limit the availability of some features, or end any Service.

You also acknowledge the risk that others may share inaccurate or misleading information about you or your organization, and that you or your organization may be mistakenly associated with content about others, for example, when we let connections and followers know you or your organization were mentioned in the news.

You acknowledge that LinkedIn does not perform these offered services, employ those who perform these services, or provide these offered products.
