Feeld safety + community guidelines
Our intention at Feeld is to create safer & more inclusive spaces for our Members that evolve alongside our community.
Inclusive
Feeld is a place for all people to feel safe exploring their desires. In this space, we approach each other with openness, curiosity, tolerance, and respectâregardless of differences. Feeling seen and respected is a fundamental human need. As we pursue it for ourselves, we extend the same grace to others.
Active consent
Both online and offline, active consent is a cornerstone of Feeld. Consent is an unambiguous âyesâ: freely given, without coercion, without manipulation, not in a state of  incapacitation. It is a âyes,â made intentionally, by a person who is informed about what will and will not happen in an exchange. Itâs a âyesâ that can be retracted at any time.
Private
Revealing ourselves to others is deeply personal. Sometimes we feel comfortable sharing, and sometimes we donât. On Feeld, each of us gets to decide how, when, and with whom we share ourselves through features like âHide Me on Feeldâ and âIncognitoâ. Privacy doesnât contradict authenticity. It lives alongside it and enables it as we pursue honest, meaningful connections.
Authentic
We are who we say we are. Fake Member profiles, catfishing, impersonations, or other intentional misrepresentations of identity are not allowed. In this space, weâre real people bringing as much of ourselves as we wish to each interaction. Doing so allows us to form more meaningful connectionsânot only with others, but with ourselves.
Safer
If someone makes you feel unsafe on Feeld, we want to know and take appropriate action. Please report any harassment, abuse, threats, discriminatory behavior, or misconduct that you witness or experience. To protect your identity, your report will remain anonymous. We will either warn or remove people who violate our community guidelines. Your reports are an essential part of creating a safer community together.
Evolving
As our community grows and evolves, our safety practices will too. If you feel unsafe and need to report a specific case of misconduct or a safety issue, please email

Policy Breakdown
This is a breakdown of our policies.
Personal Information
Gathering information
We do not allow anyone to gather the data of our community for reasons beyond forming meaningful connections.
Sharing information
We strongly advise our community to use caution when sharing their personal information (phone numbers, social media handles, etc.), their photos, their videos, as well as engaging in intimate video calls with other people. Staying safer means building trust with another before sharing personal details.
Solicitation
Sexual solicitation
While everyone is welcome to use Feeld in a personal capacity, we cannot allow erotic and sexual solicitation on Feeld.
Financial domination (FinDom)
While we recognize the expression of this kink, we cannot provide space for financial domination on Feeld. FinDom is an activity in which a submissive is required to give gifts or money to a dominant.
Selling goods and services (including events)
We do not allow people to sell goods or services, including advertising events with tickets, on Feeld.
Catfishing and Fake Images
We don't allow Members to use other peoples' photos without their consent, as this is inauthentic and sets the stage for misrepresentation within the community. This includes, but is not limited to, the use of internet images and images of public figures.
Identity Theft  and Compromised Accounts
We do not allow identity theft, or the impersonation of private or public individuals on Feeld. Feeld is a community of real people, here to explore their authentic selves.
Harassment and Hate speech
We do not accept harassment and hostile speech that creates an unsafe space for the Feeld community or our staff. This includes messages that make people feel unsafeâincluding bullying, non-consensual images or messages, hate speech, or behaviors not in keeping with our community guidelines, such as malicious reporting.
Sextortion
We have a zero-tolerance policy for sextortion, which we define as any request for financial compensation in exchange for not releasing intimate or sensitive images or videos.
NCII, Revenge porn, or Blackmail
We have a zero-tolerance policy for non-consensual intimate imagery (NCII), also known as revenge porn, which is any non-consensual sharing of intimate or locally sensitive imagery.
Prohibited Images
We cannot allow public photos that contain nudity, restricted goods, or minors.
Nudity
Due to our partner regulations, we cannot allow close ups of genitalia or bulges, buttocks where they are the focus of the image, and female-presenting breasts with nipples exposed. Feeld profiles with any of the above will be asked to change or remove these images.
Restricted goods
Due to our partner regulations, and legal or regulatory considerations, we cannot allow photos of restricted goodsâsuch as drugs or gun paraphernaliaâto remain on Feeld.
Minors
Even if they are in the background, we are unable to allow any images of children under the age of 18 on Feeld. This is because we are an adults-only dating app. Feeld profiles containing any images of children will be asked to change or remove them.
AI Generated Images
Malicious use of AI generated images are prohibited on our platform.
Physical and Sexual Abuse
We have a zero-tolerance policy regarding physical and sexual abuse. When such abuse is reported, incited, or verbally threatened, the person responsible will be removed from our platform.
CSAM
We have a zero-tolerance policy for any child sexual abuse materials (CSAM), which includes any pornographic or sexually suggestive photos of persons under the age of 18. If found, these cases may be escalated to law enforcement in appropriate jurisdictions.
Bestiality
We cannot allow any images or other depictions of bestiality, defined as sexual acts between a human and an animal due to legal restrictions in countries where we operate.
Under-18
Feeld is a strictly adults-only dating app (18+). We do not allow any underage people to be present on Feeld. Profiles will be reviewed, and if underage, they will be removed.
Crime (Other)
We don't allow the coordination or perpetration of any kind of criminal activity on Feeld. This includes robbery, stalking, or any other crimes not listed here. We endeavor to assist law enforcement where possible to effectively protect our community in every global region where our app is supported.
Fraud
Fraud is any strategy that attempts to dishonestly and intentionally extract money or information from people on Feeld. Acts of deception or misrepresentation are not tolerated within the Feeld community.
