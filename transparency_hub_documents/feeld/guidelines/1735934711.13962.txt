Safety | FeeldDownloadAboutThe AppExperiencesMagazineCareersAboutThe AppExperiencesMagazineCareersDownload FeeldScan to downloadFeeld safety + community guidelinesOur intention at Feeld is to create safer & more inclusive spaces for our Members that evolve alongside our community. InclusiveFeeld is a place for all people to feel safe exploring their desires. In this space, we approach each other with openness, curiosity, tolerance, and respectâregardless of differences. Feeling seen and respected is a fundamental human need. As we pursue it for ourselves, we extend the same grace to others.Active consent Both online and offline, active consent is a cornerstone of Feeld. Consent is an unambiguous âyesâ: freely given, without coercion, without manipulation, not in a state of  incapacitation. It is a âyes,â made intentionally, by a person who is informed about what will and will not happen in an exchange. Itâs a âyesâ that can be retracted at any time.PrivateRevealing ourselves to others is deeply personal. Sometimes we feel comfortable sharing, and sometimes we donât. On Feeld, each of us gets to decide how, when, and with whom we share ourselves through features like âHide Me on Feeldâ and âIncognitoâ. Privacy doesnât contradict authenticity. It lives alongside it and enables it as we pursue honest, meaningful connections.AuthenticWe are who we say we are. Fake Member profiles, catfishing, impersonations, or other intentional misrepresentations of identity are not allowed. In this space, weâre real people bringing as much of ourselves as we wish to each interaction. Doing so allows us to form more meaningful connectionsânot only with others, but with ourselves.SaferIf someone makes you feel unsafe on Feeld, we want to know and take appropriate action.
