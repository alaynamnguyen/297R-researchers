<p>c.&nbsp;Criminal History.&nbsp;By requesting to use, registering to use, and/or using the Singles Service, you represent and warrant that you have never been convicted of a felony (or other indictable offense) and/or are not required to register as a sex offender with any government entity.&nbsp;<strong>EHARMONY DOES NOT CURRENTLY CONDUCT CRIMINAL BACKGROUND SCREENINGS ON ITS MEMBERS</strong>. However, to the extent permissible by applicable law, eHarmony reserves the right to conduct any criminal background checks, at any time and using available public records, to confirm your compliance with this subsection. BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, YOU HEREBY AUTHORIZE ANY SUCH CHECK IF IT IS LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE IN YOUR JURISDICTION.</p>



<p>d.&nbsp;Meeting Matching System Criteria.&nbsp;The Singles Service requires your completion of the Compatibility Quiz for eharmony to find highly compatible potential partners. eharmony will not be able to provide partner suggestions to users who have not completed the Compatibility Quiz.</p>



<p id="tc01"><strong>2. Use of the Services.</strong></p>



<p>As a user of any of the Services (a &#8220;Registered User&#8221;), you agree to the following:</p>



<p>a.&nbsp;Basic Membership.&nbsp;It is free to register for the Singles Service, which may be used by you at no cost (“Basic Membership”). Once you have registered by providing preliminary information (including email address and password), you will be asked to answer a scientifically-based Compatibility Quiz which has been structured by reference to specific psychological criteria. The results of the Compatibility Quiz as well as comprehensive statistical comparative data are used by eharmony to automatically create your individual personality profile. Your personality profile will then be integrated into the eharmony database. Once in our database, your personality profile is (through an automated process) matched up to the profiles of other eharmony members, which enables eharmony to determine your compatibility with those members. Using this information, eharmony will send you partner recommendations, which will appear in your online profile and be sent via email. This information will be provided to you as a condensed profile of the other compatible members, each containing a short description of the member, your compatibility score, along with their primary profile photo. Please note that, as a Basic member, you will generally only be able to view blurred versions of other users’ profile photos. However, you may be able to see an unblurred version of their primary profile photo in some instances, at our discretion. As a Basic member, you may send an unlimited number of predefined communications (for example, a smile) to other users subject to the terms of this Agreement; however, you will only have a limited ability to send and read personalized messages. Please note that we may limit the number of predefined communications that you can send if required to protect our members and to secure our Service as further set out in this Agreement. As a Basic member, you will not receive a copy of your personality profile, but you may purchase a PDF copy of the personality profile for the price listed on the Service at the time of purchase.<br>In addition, in some countries, eharmony offers for purchase virtual goods to extend rights of use, in particular, of a Basic Membership (e.g., Match Unlocks as described in Section 2(b)(ii)).</p>



<p id="tc_unlockTerms">b.&nbsp;Premium Membership and Virtual Goods.&nbsp;The Singles Service includes services subject to a fee, including a Premium Membership option and, in some locales, virtual goods that extend the rights of use in your Basic Membership (collectively, “paid-for services”). Paid-for services offer features not generally available under a Basic Membership. Please note that concluding a contract with eharmony for paid-for services is subject to the respective payment service provider verifying and processing the purchase.</p>



<ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Premium Membership:</strong> If you purchase a Premium Membership, you will regularly receive updated partner suggestions from eharmony in your online profile and via email. These will be updated to include new members who have been added to our database since you became a Premium member. As a Premium member, you will be able to see unblurred photos of other users (primary and any additional photos), contact and initiate communication with other users (including video chat), conduct searches for potential partners based on specific criteria and respond to their communications without restriction (including video chat). Please note that we may still limit the number of communications that you can send if required to protect our members and to secure our Service as further set out in this Agreement. eharmony will also provide access to the personality profile to each Premium member within their account settings.</li>



<li><strong>Virtual Goods:</strong>&nbsp;The purchase of virtual goods (e.g., Match Unlocks) is subject to a charge. Virtual goods can be used for individual services or for certain features in one&#8217;s own profile. For example, Match Unlocks can be used to unlock profile pictures for individual matches and unlimited communication in accordance with these Terms and Conditions. eharmony reserves the right to place limitations and other conditions on the offer of virtual goods, at our discretion. Match Unlocks may not be available in your locale.<br>Additional terms applicable to Match Unlocks:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Your use of Match Unlocks is subject to Clause 2(l) of these Terms and Conditions.</li>



<li>Match Unlocks are linked to and stored in your Basic Membership account. They cannot be transferred to a Premium Membership or to other members, nor can they be traded in, exchanged for money, or used to settle outstanding payments.</li>



<li>If you purchase a Premium Membership, any unredeemed Match Unlocks pause until your Premium Membership ends and your account reverts to a Basic Membership.</li>



<li>Match Unlocks expire either four (4) years after purchase or two (2) years of inactivity on your account, or if you direct us to delete your data, whichever is earlier.</li>



<li>If you and the profile you have chosen to unlock are already able to communicate without limitation, using a Match Unlock will only enable you to view all their posted photos.</li>

<p id="tc14"><strong>14. Governing Law &amp; Venue</strong></p>



<p>Unless prohibited by local law, this Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of laws. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Section 15 of this Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. Any action to compel arbitration, or challenging the enforceability or applicability of the arbitration provisions herein, must be filed in the federal or state courts of Delaware. Any action filed in any other court shall be transferred to, or dismissed without prejudice for refiling only in, the federal or state courts of Delaware, after removal to the appropriate federal court, if applicable, for determination by the Delaware federal or state court as to whether the action should be stayed pending, or otherwise referred to, arbitration. Any claims that are not referred to arbitration must be adjudicated exclusively in the federal or state courts of Delaware. For such claims, the federal and state courts of Delaware shall have exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue over you and us, and you and we waive any objection based on inconvenient forum. If either party files suit in any court other than the federal or state courts of Delaware, in deciding whether to transfer or dismiss the action, or otherwise give effect to this provision, the court shall apply the standard set forth in <em>Atlantic Marine Construction Co. v. U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas</em>, 571 U.S. 49 (2013). The parties also agree that transfer or dismissal cannot be denied based on inconvenience to the parties, piecemeal adjudication of the claims, a risk of inconsistent findings of law or fact, the presence of other parties who are not party to these terms, or any other private or public considerations.</p>



<p>Nothing in this Agreement is intended to limit a party’s right to seek equitable relief at any time. If the Arbitration Agreement (as set forth in Section 15) is held to be unenforceable, you and we agree that any claims or disputes that you or we have against each other must be resolved in the federal or state courts located in Delaware to the extent permissible by applicable law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims appropriately brought in small claims court may be filed in any court of competent jurisdiction. <strong>For the sake of clarity, the choice of Delaware law shall not exclude, limit or supersede a consumer’s rights or remedies under mandatory consumer protection laws in the jurisdiction where the consumer resides</strong>.</p>



<p id="tc15"><strong>15. Arbitration Agreement, Class Action Waiver and Jury Trial Waiver</strong></p>



<p><strong>a.&nbsp;Purpose:&nbsp;</strong>This section 15 of the Agreement (henceforth referred to as “Arbitration Agreement&#8221;) facilitates the prompt and efficient resolution of any Disputes that may arise between you and eharmony. Arbitration is a form of private Dispute (as defined below) resolution in which parties to a contract agree to submit their Disputes and potential Disputes to a neutral third person (called an arbitrator) for a binding decision, instead of having such Dispute(s) decided in a lawsuit, in court, by a judge or jury trial.</p>



<p>Please read this Arbitration Agreement carefully. It provides that all Disputes between you and eharmony shall be resolved by binding arbitration. <strong>Arbitration replaces the right to go to court. In the absence of this Arbitration Agreement, you may otherwise have a right or opportunity to bring claims in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate in or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including, but not limited to, class actions). Entering into this Arbitration Agreement constitutes a waiver of your and our right to litigate claims in court and all opportunity to be heard by a judge or jury. </strong>There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. The arbitrator must follow this Arbitration Agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney’s fees, if otherwise authorized by applicable law).</p>



<p>For the purpose of this Arbitration Agreement, “eharmony” means eHarmony, Inc. and its parents, subsidiaries, and affiliated companies, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents. The term “Dispute” means any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and eharmony regarding any aspect of your relationship with eharmony, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, negligence, gross negligence or reckless behavior), or any other legal or equitable theory, and includes the validity, enforceability or scope of this Arbitration Agreement (with the exception of the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver in this Arbitration Agreement). “Dispute” is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced.</p>



<p><strong>YOU AND EHARMONY EACH AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW, ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, AS DEFINED ABOVE, WHETHER PRESENTLY IN EXISTENCE OR BASED ON ACTS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PAST OR IN THE FUTURE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.</strong></p>



<p><strong>b.&nbsp;Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution: </strong>For all Disputes, you and we must first give each other an opportunity to resolve the Dispute before commencing arbitration. You must commence any Dispute you have with us by mailing written notification to eHarmony, Inc., c/o The Corporation Trust Company, 1209 Orange Street, Wilmington, DE 19801. That written notification must include (1) your name, (2) your address, (3) your phone number, (4) your email address used to create your eharmony account, (5) a written description of the Dispute, (6) a description of the specific relief you seek, and (7) your personal signature. If eharmony does not resolve the Dispute to your satisfaction within 45 days after it receives your written notification, you may pursue your Dispute in arbitration. We must commence any Dispute we have with you by sending you a written notification to the email address used to create your eharmony account that includes a written description of the Dispute and a description of the specific relief we seek. If the Dispute is not resolved to our satisfaction within 45 days after you receive our written notification, we may pursue our Dispute in arbitration. Either party may communicate directly with the other in an effort to satisfy or resolve any Dispute, including by communicating any offers or demands.</p>



<p><strong>c.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Arbitration Procedures:</strong>&nbsp;If this Arbitration Agreement applies and the Dispute is not resolved as provided above (“Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution”) either you or eharmony may initiate arbitration proceedings. The American Arbitration Association (“AAA”),&nbsp;<a href="https://www.adr.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">www.adr.org</a>&nbsp;will arbitrate all Disputes, and the arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator. The arbitration shall be commenced as an individual arbitration, and shall in no event be commenced as a representative or class arbitration. However, this shall not preclude the application of Section 15k below. All issues shall be for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this Arbitration Agreement.</p>



<p>For arbitration before the AAA, for Disputes of less than $75,000 USD, the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules will apply; for Disputes involving $75,000 USD or more, the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply. In either instance, the AAA’s Optional Rules For Emergency Measures Of Protection shall apply. The AAA rules are available at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.adr.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">www.adr.org</a>&nbsp;or by calling 1-800-778-7879. This Arbitration Agreement governs in the event it conflicts with the applicable arbitration rules. Under no circumstances will class action procedures or rules apply to the arbitration. However, this shall not preclude the application of Section 15k below.</p>



<p>In the event of a Mass Filing (defined in Section 15k below), the procedures, fees, and costs described in Section 15k will govern notwithstanding any applicable rule of the arbitration provider to the contrary.</p>



<p>Because your contract with eharmony, the Agreement, and this Arbitration Agreement concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) governs the arbitrability of all Disputes. However, the arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and the applicable statute of limitations or condition precedent to suit.</p>



<p><strong>d.&nbsp;Arbitration Award:</strong>&nbsp;The arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available pursuant to applicable law, and will not have the power to award relief to, against or for the benefit of any person who is not a party to the proceeding. The arbitrator shall make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. Such award by the arbitrator will be final and binding on the parties, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.</p>



<p><strong>e.&nbsp;Location of Arbitration:</strong>&nbsp;The arbitration may be heard in Delaware, as otherwise required by the arbitration provider’s rules, or in another location mutually agreed to by the parties. The parties may appear via teleconference as though they were appearing in person unless otherwise ordered by the arbitrator.</p>



<p><strong>f.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Payment of Arbitration Fees and Costs</strong>: The initiating party must pay all filing fees that the arbitration provider requires to be paid by the initiating party. Your and our responsibility to pay other administrative and arbitrator fees and costs will also be as set forth in the applicable arbitration provider’s rules, unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. If a claim is determined to be frivolous, the claimant is responsible for reimbursing the respondent for its portion of all such administrative, hearing, filing, and/or other fees incurred as a result of the frivolous claim. The arbitration provider may also impose such obligation on the claimant’s attorneys. Fees, costs, and sanctions may also be awarded in the arbitration against a party of a party’s attorney as provided pursuant to applicable law. You may qualify for a waiver of certain arbitration costs under the arbitration provider’s rules or other applicable law. If you meet the standard for proceeding in forma pauperis in federal court, Delaware state court, or the courts of your state of residence, cannot obtain a waiver from the arbitration provider of any filing fees you are required to pay, and the arbitration provider refuses to administer the arbitration without your payment of said fees, eharmony will pay the filing fees for you.</p>



<p><strong>g.&nbsp;Class Action Waiver: </strong>The parties agree that the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a class or representative proceeding or claims (such as a class action, representative action, consolidated action or private attorney general action), except as set forth in Section 15k below, unless both you and eharmony specifically agree in writing to do so following initiation of the arbitration. Neither you, nor any other Registered Member of eharmony and/or user of eharmony services, can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, representative, consolidated or private attorney general proceeding, except as set forth in Section 15k below.</p>



<p><strong>h.&nbsp; Limitation of Procedural Rights: </strong>You understand and agree that, by entering into this Arbitration Agreement, you and eharmony are each agreeing to arbitration instead of the right to a trial before a judge or jury in a public court. In the absence of this Arbitration Agreement, you and eharmony might otherwise have had a right or opportunity to bring Disputes in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including class actions). You and we give up those rights. Other rights that you or we would have if you or we went to court, such as the right to appeal and to certain types of discovery, may be more limited in arbitration. The right to appellate review of an arbitrator’s decision is much more limited than in court, and in general an arbitrator’s decision may not be appealed for errors of fact or law.</p>



<p><strong>i.&nbsp;Severability: </strong>If any clause within this Arbitration Agreement (other than the Class Action Waiver clause above and Mass Filing clause below) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this Arbitration Agreement, and the remainder of this Arbitration Agreement will be given full force and effect. If the Class Action Waiver or Mass Filing clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then this entire Arbitration Agreement will be unenforceable, and the Dispute will be decided by a court.</p>



<p><strong>j.&nbsp;Continuation:</strong>&nbsp;This Arbitration Agreement shall survive the termination of your contract with eharmony and your use of eharmony Services.</p>



<p><strong>k. Mass Filing: </strong>If, at any time, 25 or more similar demands for arbitration are asserted against us or related parties by the same or coordinated counsel or entities, or if we assert 25 or more similar demands for arbitration or counterclaims against similarly situated parties, within a period of 60 days or otherwise close in proximity (“Mass Filing”), the additional protocols set forth below shall apply:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Acknowledgment of Mass Filing Protocols</strong>. If you or we, or you or our counsel, files a demand for arbitration that fits within the definition of Mass Filing referred to above, then you and we agree that the demand for arbitration shall be subject to the additional protocols set forth in this Mass Filing subsection. If the parties disagree as to whether a series of filings fits within the definition of Mass Filing above, the arbitration provider shall resolve the disagreement. You and we also acknowledge that the adjudication of the dispute may be delayed and that any applicable statute of limitations shall be tolled from the time of filing of the demand for arbitration, and pending resolution of the bellwether proceedings.</li>



<li><strong>Bellwether Arbitrations</strong>.&nbsp;Bellwether proceedings are encouraged by courts and arbitration administrators where there are multiple disputes involving similar claims against the same or related parties. The parties shall select ten individual arbitration claims (five per side), designated the “Initial Test Cases,” to proceed to arbitration. Only the Initial Test Cases shall be filed with the arbitrator. All other claims shall be held in abeyance. This means that the filing fees will be paid only for the Initial Test Cases; for all other demands for arbitration in a Mass Filing, the filing fees (together with any arbitrator consideration of the other demands) will be in abeyance, and neither you nor eharmony will be required to pay any such filing fees. You and eharmony also agree that neither you nor we shall be deemed to be in breach of this Arbitration Agreement for failure to pay any such filing fees, and that neither you nor we shall be entitled to any contractual, statutory, or other remedies, damages, or sanctions of any kind for failure to pay any such filing fees. If, pursuant to this subsection, a party files non-Bellwether Arbitrations with the arbitration provider, the parties agree that the arbitration provider shall hold those demands in abeyance and not refer them to the arbitrator pending resolution of the Initial Test Cases. Unless the claims are resolved in advance or the schedule is extended, the arbitrators will render a final award for the Initial Test Cases within 120 days of the initial pre-hearing conference.</li>



<li><strong>Global Mediation</strong>.&nbsp;Following the resolution of the Initial Test Cases, the parties agree to engage in a global mediation of all the remaining individual arbitration claims comprising the Mass Filing (“Global Mediation”), deferring any filing costs associated with the non-Initial Test Cases until the Initial Test Cases and subsequent Global Mediation have concluded. After the final awards are provided to the mediator in the Initial Test Cases, the mediator and the parties shall have 90 days to agree upon a substantive methodology and make an offer to resolve the outstanding cases. If the Parties are unable to resolve the outstanding claims during the Global Mediation, the remaining claims shall proceed in court unless the parties agree to an alternative procedure. You and we also acknowledge that any applicable statute of limitations shall be tolled pending resolution of the global mediation process.</li>



<li><strong>Arbitration Provider’s Authority to Apply Mass Filing Rules</strong>. Notwithstanding this Section 15k, if a series of arbitration demands is determined by the arbitration provider not to constitute a Mass Filing pursuant to this Arbitration Agreement, but such demands constitute a mass filing pursuant to the arbitration provider’s mass filing rules, the arbitration provider may apply its mass filing rules, procedures, and fees.</li>



<li><strong>Enforcement of Subsection</strong>. A Court of competent jurisdiction located in federal or state court in Delaware shall have the power to enforce this subsection 15k.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>l. Unavailability: </strong>If for some reason AAA is not available to administer the arbitration and you live in California, the arbitration will be administered by ADR Services, Inc. pursuant to its then in-effect arbitration rules and procedures, available at <a href="https://www.adrservices.com/services-2/arbitration-rules/">https://www.adrservices.com/services-2/arbitration-rules/</a>. If for some reason AAA is not available to administer the arbitration and you live outside of California, the arbitration will be administered by National Arbitration and Mediation pursuant to its most current Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures, available at https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms, or under its most current Supplemental Rules for Mass Arbitrations, as applicable, available at <a href="https://www.namadr.com/content/uploads/2021/12/SupplementalRules12.22.21.pdf.">https://www.namadr.com/content/uploads/2021/12/SupplementalRules12.22.21.pdf.</a> If none of these arbitration providers is available, including because it is not able to administer the arbitration(s) consistent with the rules, procedures, and terms of this arbitration agreement, including those regarding mass filings, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum, with comparable fees and procedures for mass filings, if applicable. If the parties cannot agree on an appropriate alternative arbitration provider, then the parties will ask a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint an arbitrator pursuant to 9 U.S.C. § 5 that is able to administer the arbitration(s) consistent with the rules, procedures, and terms of this arbitration agreement, including those regarding mass filings, if applicable. If no such arbitration provider is available, the dispute shall be resolved in state or federal court in Delaware.</p>



<p id="tc16"><strong>16. General Provisions</strong></p>



<p>a.&nbsp;Right to Seek Injunction.&nbsp;Violation of this Agreement may cause eharmony irreparable harm, and therefore agree that eharmony will be entitled to seek extraordinary relief in court, including but not limited to temporary restraining orders, preliminary injunctions and permanent injunctions without the necessity of posting a bond or other security, in addition to and without prejudice to any other rights or remedies that eharmony may have for a breach of this Agreement.</p>



<p>b.&nbsp;Miscellaneous.&nbsp;This Agreement, which you accept upon registration for the Services, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eharmony.com/privacypolicy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Privacy Policy</a>&nbsp;located on the Services, and any applicable payment, renewal, additional Services terms, comprise the entire agreement between you and eharmony regarding the use of this Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and eharmony related to your use of the Services (including, but not limited to, any prior versions of this Agreement). The FAQ&#8217;s found on the Services are for informational purposes only and are not deemed to be part of this Agreement. Unless otherwise explicitly stated, the Agreement will survive termination of your registration to the Services. The failure of eharmony to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement does not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect. The section titles in this Agreement are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.</p>
