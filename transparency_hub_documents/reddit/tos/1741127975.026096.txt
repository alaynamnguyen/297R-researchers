Reddit User Agreement if you live in the United States or outside the EEA, United Kingdom, and Switzerland
Hello, redditors and people of the Internet! This Reddit User Agreement (“
Terms
”) applies to your access to and use of the websites, mobile apps, widgets, APIs, emails, and other online products and services (collectively, the “
Services
”) provided by Reddit, Inc. (“
Reddit
,” “
we
,” “
us
,” or “
our
”).
Remember Reddit is for fun and is intended to be a place for your entertainment, but we still need some basic rules. By accessing or using our Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not access or use our Services
1. Your Access to the Services
No one under 13 is allowed to use or access the Services. We may offer additional Services that require you to be older to use them, so please read all notices and any Additional Terms carefully when you access the Services.
By using the Services, you state that:
You are at least 13 years old and over the minimum age required by the laws of your country of residence to access and use the Services;
You can form a binding contract with Reddit, or, if you are over 13 but under the age of majority in your jurisdiction, that your legal guardian has reviewed and agrees to these Terms;
You are not barred from using the Services under all applicable laws; and
You have not been permanently suspended or removed from the Services.
If you are accepting these Terms on behalf of another legal entity, including a business or government entity, you represent that you have full legal authority to bind such entity to these Terms.
2. Privacy
Reddit’s
Privacy Policy
explains how and why we collect, use, and share information about you when you access or use our Services. You understand that through your use of the Services, you consent to the collection and use of this information as set forth in the
Privacy Policy
.
3. Your Use of the Services
Subject to your complete and ongoing compliance with these Terms, Reddit grants you a personal, non-transferable, non-exclusive, revocable, limited license to: (a) install and use a copy of our mobile application associated with the Services that is obtained from a legitimate marketplace on a mobile device owned or controlled by you; and (b) access and use the Services. We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you by these Terms.
Except and solely to the extent such a restriction is impermissible under applicable law, you may not, without our written agreement:
license, sell, transfer, assign, distribute, host, or otherwise commercially exploit the Services or Content;
modify, prepare derivative works of, disassemble, decompile, or reverse engineer any part of the Services or Content; or
access the Services or Content in order to build a similar or competitive website, product, or service, except as permitted under any Additional Terms (as defined below).
We are always improving our Services. This means we may add or remove features, products, or functionalities; we will try to notify you beforehand, but that won’t always be possible. We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Services (in whole or in part) at any time, with or without notice to you. Any future release, update, or other addition to functionality of the Services will be subject to these Terms, which may be updated from time to time. You agree that we will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Services or any part thereof.
We personalize your experience on the Services based on a variety of factors, including your activity on the Services, communities you are subscribed to, and preferences you’ve identified in your settings. Based on these and other factors, we may make recommendations to make your experience on Reddit more relevant. For more information about your content recommendations, as well as a description of how you can control certain personalization options, please see our
Help Center
.
4. Your Reddit Account and Account Security
To use certain features of our Services, you may be required to create a Reddit account (an “
Account
”) and provide us with a username, password, and certain other information about yourself as set forth in the
Privacy Policy
.
You are solely responsible for the information associated with your Account and anything that happens related to your Account. You must maintain the security of your Account and immediately
notify Reddit
if you discover or suspect that someone has accessed your Account without your permission. We recommend that you use a strong password that is used only with your Account and
enable two-factor authentication
. If you add your phone number to your Account and later change or deactivate your phone number, make sure to update your Account information.
You will not license, sell, or transfer your Account without our prior written approval.
5. Your Content
The Services may contain information, text, links, graphics, photos, videos, audio, streams, software, tools, or other materials (“
Content
”), including Content created with or submitted to the Services by you or through your Account (“
Your Content
”). We take no responsibility for and we do not expressly or implicitly endorse, support, or guarantee the completeness, truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of any of Your Content.
By submitting Your Content to the Services, you represent and warrant that you have all rights, power, and authority necessary to grant the rights to Your Content contained within these Terms. Because you alone are responsible for Your Content, you may expose yourself to liability if you post or share Content without all necessary rights.
You retain any ownership rights you have in Your Content, but you grant Reddit the following license to use that Content:
When Your Content is created with or submitted to the Services, you grant us a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, transferable, and sublicensable license to use, copy, modify, adapt, prepare derivative works of, distribute, store, perform, and display Your Content and any name, username, voice, or likeness provided in connection with Your Content in all media formats and channels now known or later developed anywhere in the world. This license includes the right for us to make Your Content available for syndication, broadcast, distribution, or publication by other companies, organizations, or individuals who partner with Reddit. For example, this license includes the right to use Your Content to train AI and machine learning models, as further described in our
Public Content Policy
. You also agree that we may remove metadata associated with Your Content, and you irrevocably waive any claims and assertions of moral rights or attribution with respect to Your Content.
Any ideas, suggestions, and feedback about Reddit or our Services that you provide to us are entirely voluntary, and you agree that Reddit may use such ideas, suggestions, and feedback without compensation or obligation to you.
Although we have no obligation to screen, edit, or monitor Your Content, we may, in our sole discretion, delete, deem your content ineligible for monetization, or remove Your Content, at any time and for any reason, including for violating these Terms, our
Reddit Rules
, or our
other terms and policies
, or if you otherwise create or are likely to create liability for us.
For more information about Reddit’s approach to content moderation, including how we enforce our
Reddit Rules
and how to appeal content moderation decisions, please visit our
Help Center.
6. Third-Party Content, Advertisements, and Promotions
The Services may contain links to third-party websites, products, or services, which may be posted by advertisers, our affiliates, our partners, or other users (“
Third-Party Content
”). Third-Party Content is not under our control, and we are not responsible for any third party’s websites, products, or services. Your use of Third-Party Content is at your own risk and you should make any investigation you feel necessary before proceeding with any transaction in connection with such Third-Party Content.
The Services may also contain sponsored Third-Party Content or advertisements. The type, degree, and targeting of advertisements are subject to change, and you acknowledge and agree that we may place advertisements in connection with the display of any Content or information on the Services, including Your Content.
If you choose to use the Services to conduct a promotion, including a contest or sweepstakes (“
Promotion
”), you alone are responsible for conducting the Promotion in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, including creating official rules, offer terms, eligibility requirements, and compliance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations which govern the Promotion (such as licenses, registrations, bonds, and regulatory approval). Your Promotion must state that the Promotion is not sponsored by, endorsed by, or associated with Reddit, and the rules for your Promotion must require each entrant or participant to release Reddit from any liability related to the Promotion. You acknowledge and agree that we will not assist you in any way with your Promotion, and you agree to conduct your Promotion at your own risk.
7. Things You Cannot Do
When using or accessing the Services, you must comply with these Terms and all applicable laws, rules, and regulations. Please review the
Reddit Rules
, which is incorporated by this reference into, and made a part of, these Terms and contain Reddit’s rules about prohibited content and conduct. In addition to what is prohibited in the
Reddit Rules
,
you may not do any of the following:
Use the Services in any manner that could interfere with, disable, disrupt, overburden, or otherwise impair the Services;
Gain access to (or attempt to gain access to) another user’s Account or any non-public portions of the Services, including the computer systems or networks connected to or used together with the Services;
Upload, transmit, or distribute to or through the Services any viruses, worms, malicious code, or other software intended to interfere with the Services, including its security-related features;
Use the Services to violate applicable law or infringe any person’s or entity’s intellectual property rights or any other proprietary rights;
Access, search, or collect data from the Services by any means (automated or otherwise) except as permitted in these Terms or in a separate agreement with Reddit (we conditionally grant permission to crawl the Services in accordance with the parameters set forth in our robots.txt file, but scraping the Services without Reddit’s prior written consent is prohibited); or
Use the Services in any manner that we reasonably believe to be an abuse of or fraud on Reddit or any payment system.
We encourage you to
report
content or conduct that you believe violates these Terms or our
Reddit Rules
. We also support the responsible reporting of security vulnerabilities. To report a security issue, please email
security@reddit.com
.
8. Moderators
Moderating a subreddit is an unofficial, voluntary position that may be available to users of the Services. We are not responsible for actions taken by the moderators. We reserve the right to revoke or limit a user’s ability to moderate at any time and for any reason or no reason, including for a breach of these Terms.
If you choose to moderate a subreddit:
You agree to follow the
Moderator Code of Conduct
;
You agree that when you receive reports related to a subreddit you moderate, you will take appropriate action, which may include removing content that violates policy and/or promptly escalating to Reddit for review;
You are not, and may not represent that you are, authorized to act on behalf of Reddit;
You may not enter into any agreement with a third party on behalf of Reddit, or any subreddits that you moderate, without our written approval;
You may not perform moderation actions in return for any form of compensation, consideration, gift, or favor from third parties;
If you have access to non-public information as a result of moderating a subreddit, you will use such information only in connection with your performance as a moderator; and
You may create and enforce rules for the subreddits you moderate, provided that such rules do not conflict with these Terms, the
Reddit Rules
, or the
Moderator Code of Conduct
.
Reddit reserves the right, but has no obligation, to overturn any action or decision of a moderator if Reddit, in its sole discretion, believes that such action or decision is not in the interest of Reddit or the Reddit community.
9. Copyright, Trademark, the DMCA, and Takedowns
Reddit respects the intellectual property of others and requires that users of our Services do the same. We have a policy that includes the removal of any infringing material from the Services and for the termination, in appropriate circumstances, of users of our Services who are repeat infringers. If you believe that anything on our Services infringes a copyright or a trademark that you own or control, you may notify Reddit’s Designated Agent by filling out our
Copyright Report Form

Trademark Report Form
, or by contacting:
Copyright Agent
Reddit, Inc.

17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3)
for the requirements of a proper notification. Also, please note that if you knowingly misrepresent that any activity or material on our Services is infringing, you may be liable to Reddit for certain costs and damages.
If we remove Your Content in response to a copyright or trademark notice, we will notify you via Reddit’s private messaging system. If you believe Your Content was wrongly removed due to a mistake or misidentification in a copyright notice, you can send a counter notification via our
Copyright Counter Notice Form
or to our Copyright Agent (contact information provided above). Please see
17 U.S.C. § 512(g)(3)
for the requirements of a proper counter notification.
10. Paid Services
There are no fees for the use of many aspects of the Services. However, some services, features, and products may be available for purchase (“
Paid Services
”). In addition to these Terms, the
Reddit Econ Terms
also apply to Paid Services. By purchasing or using Paid Services, you further agree to the
Econ Terms
and, if applicable, the
Previews Terms
.
11. Intellectual Property
The Services are owned and operated by Reddit. The visual interfaces, graphics, design, compilation, information, data, computer code, products, services, trademarks, and all other elements of the Services (“
Materials
”) provided by Reddit are protected by intellectual property and other laws. All Materials included in the Services are the property of Reddit or its third-party licensors. You acknowledge and agree that you shall not acquire any ownership rights whatsoever by downloading Materials or by purchasing Paid Services. Except as expressly authorized by Reddit, and subject to Reddit’s
Brand Guidelines
, you may not make use of the Materials. Reddit reserves all rights to the Materials not granted expressly in these Terms.
12. Indemnity
Except to the extent prohibited by law, you agree to defend, indemnify, and hold Reddit, its affiliates, and their respective, directors, officers, employees, affiliates, agents, contractors, third-party service providers, and licensors (the “
Reddit Entities
”) harmless from and against any claim or demand made by any third party, and any related liability, damage, loss, and expense (including costs and attorneys’ fees) due to, arising out of, or in connection with: (a) your use of the Services; (b) your violation of these Terms; (c) your violation of applicable laws or regulations; or (d) Your Content. We reserve the right to control the defense of any matter for which you are required to indemnify us, and you agree to cooperate with our defense of these claims.
13. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability
Nothing in these Terms will prejudice the statutory rights that you may have as a user of the Services.

Privacy Policy
explains how and why we collect, use, and share information about you when you access or use our Services. You understand that through your use of the Services, you consent to the collection and use of this information as set forth in the
Privacy Policy
.
3. Your Use of the Services
Subject to your complete and ongoing compliance with these Terms, Reddit grants you a personal, non-transferable, non-exclusive, revocable, limited license to: (a) install and use a copy of our mobile application associated with the Services that is obtained from a legitimate marketplace on a mobile device owned or controlled by you; and (b) access and use the Services. We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you by these Terms.

modify, prepare derivative works of, disassemble, decompile, or reverse engineer any part of the Services or Content; or
access the Services or Content in order to build a similar or competitive website, product, or service, except as permitted under any Additional Terms (as defined below).

You are solely responsible for the information associated with your Account and anything that happens related to your Account. You must maintain the security of your Account and immediately
notify Reddit

For example, this license includes the right to use Your Content to train AI and machine learning models, as further described in our
Public Content Policy
. You also agree that we may remove metadata associated with Your Content, and you irrevocably waive any claims and assertions of moral rights or attribution with respect to Your Content.
Any ideas, suggestions, and feedback about Reddit or our Services that you provide to us are entirely voluntary, and you agree that Reddit may use such ideas, suggestions, and feedback without compensation or obligation to you.
Although we reserve the right to review, screen, edit, or monitor Your Content, we do not necessarily review all of it at the time it is submitted to the Services. However, we may, in our sole discretion, delete, deem your content ineligible for monetization, or remove Your Content at any time and for any reason, including for violating these Terms, our
Reddit Rules
, or our
other terms and policies
, or if you otherwise create or are likely to create liability for us.
