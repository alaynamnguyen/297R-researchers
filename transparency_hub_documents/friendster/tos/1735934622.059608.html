<p>Last Modified: January 3, 2024</p>
            <p>This Friendster Labs Inc. Terms of Service (the â<b>Terms</b>â) constitutes an agreement between you, the user, and Friendster Labs Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates (â<b>Friendster</b>â, â<b>we</b>â or â<b>us</b>â). These Terms govern your access to and use of the website located at friendster.com and related websites (collectively, the â<b>Website</b>â), mobile and other applications, including any content, functionality and services offered on or through the Website, the Friendster platform, and any of our other products or services (collectively, the â<b>Services</b>â), whether or not you register as a user.
            </p>
            <p>Please read the Terms carefully because they contain provisions that affect your rights and obligations, including a mandatory arbitration provision, limitation on time to file claims, and a waiver of your right to participate in a class action. By using the Services, you accept and agree to be bound and abide by these Terms and our Privacy Policy, found at friendster.com/pages/privacy, incorporated herein by reference. If you do not want to agree to these Terms or the Privacy Policy, you must not access or use the Services.

            </p>
            <p>The Services are offered and available to users who are 13 years of age or older. By using the Services, you represent and warrant that you are of legal age to form a binding contract with the Company and meet all of the foregoing eligibility requirements. If you do not meet all of these requirements, you must not access or use the Services. 

            </p>
            <p>You acknowledge and confirm that (i) you have read and understand all of the terms, conditions, guidelines, policies, provisions, disclosures and disclaimers contained herein, (ii) these Terms have the same force and effect as a signed agreement, and (iii) you expressly accept and agree to be bound by the terms hereof.

            </p>
<h2>1. Overview of the Services</h2>
<p>The Services provide a social media platform for you and our other users. The Services may allow you to participate in public and private online forums and to utilize messaging and posting features to communicate with other users of the Services. Such content is in the form of User Submitted Content as defined below and content submitted by you (âYour Submitted Contentâ).
</p>

<h2>2. User Accounts</h2>
<p>
If you choose to create an account, you will be asked to provide certain registration details or other information, such as first and last name, user name, password and email address. 
</p>
<p>
You are solely responsible for keeping your account secure and you should never share your account credentials with anyone. You should use particular caution when accessing your account from a public or shared computer so that others are not able to view or record your personal information. You are solely responsible for your account and we are not liable for any acts or omissions by you in connection with your account or as a result of your account being compromised. You agree to immediately notify us if you discover or otherwise suspect any security issues related to the Service or your account (you can contact us help@friendster.com).
</p>
<p>Your registration details and other information may not be an impersonation of another person. It is a condition of your use of the Services that all the information you provide is correct, current and complete. Friendster reserves the right to verify your identity using the information you provide to us. In the event we cannot verify your identity, Your Submitted Content may be rejected and your account may be disabled. You agree that all information you provide to register with or use the Services or otherwise is governed by our Privacy Policy, and you consent to all actions we take with respect to your information consistent with our Privacy Policy.
</p>
<h2>3. Using Friendster</h2>

<p><b>A. Third Party Content.</b> Content from other users is made available to you through Friendster. âUser Submitted Contentâ means any work of authorship or information, including user profiles, user bios, comments, opinions, postings, images, photos, videos, data or other materials you find on Friendster generated by users. 
</p>
<p>
You understand that when using the Services, you may be exposed to User Submitted Content from a variety of sources, and that we are not responsible for the accuracy, usefulness, safety, or intellectual property rights of or relating to such User Submitted Content. We do not endorse any User Submitted Content or any opinion, recommendation, or advice expressed therein, and expressly disclaim any and all liability in connection with User Submitted Content. You further understand and acknowledge that you may be exposed to User Submitted Content that is inaccurate, offensive, indecent, or objectionable, and you agree to waive, and hereby do waive, any legal or equitable rights or remedies you have or may have against us with respect thereto, and agree to indemnify and hold us, our owners/operators, affiliates, and/or licensors, harmless to the fullest extent allowed by law regarding all matters related to your use of the Services.
</p>
<p>
In accordance with Section 230 of the U.S. Communications Decency Act, and any equivalent or similar laws in other jurisdictions which are intended to exclude or limit the liability of online service providers who provide access to user-generated content, we generally cannot be held liable for claims arising from the content provided by third parties on Friendster.

<b>B.

<li>You will not interfere with, disrupt, or create an undue burden on Friendster or the networks or services connected to Friendster.</li>

<li>You will not introduce any viruses, Trojan horses, worms, time bombs, cancelbots, corrupted files, or similar software to Friendster; or attempt to circumvent any security feature of Friendster.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>C. Enforcement by Friendster.</b> While Friendster has no obligation to do so, Friendster reserves the right to review and delete any content including Your Submitted Content (or portion thereof) that we believe, in our sole discretion, violates these Terms or other applicable policies posted on Friendster (including our Community Code of Conduct and Guidelines), or that we deem, in our sole discretion, inappropriate. Friendster also reserves the right to delete or hide Your Submitted Content if requested by an individual who is identified in Your Submitted Content. If you see any content on Friendster that you believe violates our policies, you may report that content by contacting us at help@friendster.com. Once notified, we will review the content and consider whether to remove it (or a portion thereof). You understand and agree that if we choose not to remove or edit content that you find objectionable, that decision will not constitute a violation of these Terms or any agreement we have with you. 
</p><p>
Violations can also result in a temporary or permanent restriction from Friendster, terminating your account; reporting you to law enforcement, regulatory authorities, or administrative bodies; and taking legal action against you.
</p><p>
YOU WAIVE AND HOLD HARMLESS US AND OUR AFFILIATES, LICENSEES AND SERVICE PROVIDERS FROM ANY CLAIMS RESULTING FROM ANY ACTION TAKEN BY SUCH PARTIES DURING OR AS A RESULT OF OUR INVESTIGATIONS AND FROM ANY ACTIONS TAKEN AS A CONSEQUENCE OF INVESTIGATIONS BY SUCH PARTIES OR LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES.
</p><p>
We have no liability or responsibility to anyone for performance or nonperformance of the activities described in this section.</p>

<h2>4. Rights to Your Submitted Content</h2>
<p>We do not claim ownership in Your Submitted Content, but you grant us the rights to use Your Submitted Content as set forth below. By submitting or authorizing us to display Your Submitted Content on Friendster, you hereby grant to us an unrestricted, irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive, fully-paid and royalty-free, license (with the right to sublicense through unlimited levels of sublicenses) to use, copy, perform, display, create derivative works of, adapt and distribute Your Submitted Content in any and all media (now known or later developed) throughout the world. To the greatest extent permitted by applicable law, you hereby expressly waive any and all of your moral rights applicable to Friendsterâs exercise of the foregoing license. You agree that this license includes the right for us to provide, promote, and improve Friendster and to make content submitted to or through Friendster available to other companies, organizations or individuals for the syndication, broadcast, distribution, promotion or publication of such content on other media and services, subject to our terms and conditions for such content use. No compensation will be paid with respect to the content that you post through Friendster. You should only submit content to Friendster that you are comfortable sharing with others under the terms and conditions of these Terms.</p>
<p>
You understand and acknowledge that you are responsible for any content you submit or contribute, and you, not us, are fully responsible for such content, including its legality, reliability, accuracy, and appropriateness. We are not responsible, or liable to any third party, for the content or accuracy of any content posted by you or any other user of the Services. We cannot guarantee the identity of any other users with whom you may interact in the course of using the Services, or the authenticity of any data which users may provide about themselves. You acknowledge that all content accessed by you using the Services is at your own risk and you will be solely responsible for any damage or loss to any party resulting therefrom.</p>

<h2>5. Friendster Proprietary Rights</h2>
<p>
With the exception of User Submitted Content, the Services and all past, present and future content of the Services, including all software, hardware and technology used to provide the Services (including our proprietary code and third-party software), user interfaces, materials displayed or performed on the Services, such as text, graphics, articles, photographs, images, music, illustrations and the design, structure, sequence and âlook and feelâ of the Services, and all other intellectual property, including all trademarks, service marks, logos, or any other trade name, trademarks, service marks and other distinctive or proprietary brand features of us, are (i) owned by us, our licensors or other providers of such material, (ii) protected by United States and international copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other intellectual property or proprietary rights laws, (iii) are intended solely for the personal, non-commercial use of our users, and (iv) may only be used in accordance with these Terms.</p>
<p>
With the exception of Your Submitted Content, using the Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in the Services or any content on the Services. You may not use content from the Services, including User Submitted Content of others, unless you obtain permission from its owner or are otherwise permitted by law. These terms do not grant you the right to use any of our technology or intellectual property. You may not remove, obscure, or alter any copyright or other legal notices displayed in or along with the Services.</p>
<p>
No right, title or interest in or to the Services or any content on the Services is transferred to you, and all rights not expressly granted are reserved by us. Any use of the Services not expressly permitted by these Terms is a breach of these Terms and may violate copyright, trademark and other laws.</p>
<p>
We cannot protect or advise you on your intellectual property rights, and we cannot and do not take any responsibility for doing so.</p>


<h2>6. Infringement</h2>
<p>We do not knowingly permit infringement of intellectual property rights on the Services, and will remove all content if properly notified that such content infringes on anotherâs intellectual property rights. We reserve the right to remove content without prior notice. We will also terminate a userâs access to the Services, if a user is determined to be a repeat infringer.</p>

<h2>7. Disclaimer of Representations and Warranties</h2>
<p>
THE SERVICES AND ANY ASSOCIATED CONTENT ARE PROVIDED ON AN âAS ISâ AND âAS AVAILABLEâ BASIS, WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. NEITHER WE NOR ANY PERSON ASSOCIATED WITH US MAKES ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPLETENESS, SECURITY, RELIABILITY, QUALITY, ACCURACY OR AVAILABILITY OF THE SERVICES OR ANY ASSOCIATED CONTENT. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, NEITHER WE NOR ANYONE ASSOCIATED WITH US REPRESENTS OR WARRANTS THAT THE SERVICES OR ANY ASSOCIATED CONTENT WILL BE ACCURATE, RELIABLE, ERROR-FREE, UPDATED OR UNINTERRUPTED, THAT DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED, THAT THE SERVICES ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS OR THAT THE SERVICES WILL OTHERWISE MEET YOUR NEEDS OR EXPECTATIONS.</p><p>
WE HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT AND FITNESS FOR PARTICULAR PURPOSE.</p><p>
THE FOREGOING DOES NOT AFFECT ANY WARRANTIES WHICH CANNOT BE EXCLUDED OR LIMITED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.</p>

<h2>8. Limitations of Liability</h2>
<p>The disclaimers and limitations on liability in this section apply to the maximum extent allowable under applicable law. Nothing in this section is intended to limit any rights you have which may not be lawfully limited.</p><p>

You understand that we provide the Services over the Internet, that such connections can be unpredictable, insecure, and unstable, and that we cannot guarantee uninterrupted access to the Services. We disclaim all liability in connection with any security incidents or breaches arising from or attributable to an Internet and/or data connection. You agree to waive any and all claims against us in connection therewith.</p><p>

We are constantly changing and improving the Services. We reserve the right to add or remove functionalities or features of the Services, and we may suspend or stop the Services altogether, including, for example, if you do not comply with these Terms or if we are investigating suspected misconduct. You can stop using the Services at any time. We may also stop providing the Services to you, or add or create new limits to the Services or restrict your access to all or a part of the Services at any time without notice or liability. We will not be liable if for any reason all or any part of the Services are unavailable at any time or for any period. The right to access and use the Services is revoked in jurisdictions where it may be prohibited, if any.</p><p>

Friendster assumes no responsibility, and disclaims all liability, for the content, accuracy, completeness, legality, reliability, or availability of any user post, message, profile, communication or any other content. We assume no responsibility for any error, omission, interruption, deletion, defect, delay in operation or transmission, communications line failure, theft or destruction or unauthorized access to, or alteration of, any content. We are not responsible for any problems or technical malfunction of any hardware and software due to technical problems on the Internet or on Friendster or combination thereof, including any injury or damage to users or to any personâs computer related to or resulting from participation or use of the Services in connection with Friendster. Under no circumstances shall we be responsible for any loss or damage resulting from the use of Friendster or from any content posted on Friendster or transmitted to users, or any interactions between users of Friendster, whether online or offline.
</p><p>

YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES AND ALL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES DELIVERED TO YOU THROUGH THE SERVICE AND ANY CONTENT ON THE SERVICES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND DISCRETION. You may not assert claims for money damages arising from the Services or any associated content against us, our affiliates, licensors or service providers, or our respective employees, contractors, officers, directors and agents. We, our affiliates, licensors and service providers, and our respective employees, contractors, officers, directors and agents shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, consequential or punitive damages, including but not limited to personal injury, pain and suffering, emotional distress, or loss of revenue, profits, goodwill or data, whether caused by tort (including negligence), breach of contract or otherwise, even if we knew or should have known of the possibility of such damages, arising out of or in connection with (i) your use, or inability to use, the Services, any associated content, or any products and/or services delivered to you through the Service, (ii) any interaction with any third party, through or in connection with the Services, including other users, (iii) any information offered or provided within or through the Services, or (iv) any other matter relating to the Services. 
</p><p>
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall we, our affiliates, licensors or service providers, or our respective employees, contractors, officers, directors and agents be liable to you in the aggregate (for all potential claims by you) for any damages incurred in excess of one hundred dollars ($100). Because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or the limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such states or jurisdictions, our liability shall be limited to the extent permitted by law.</p>

<h2>9. Changes to these Terms</h2>
<p>
We may modify these Terms at any time in our sole discretion by posting a revised version on our website at [TERMS OF SERVICE URL] [and our related mobile application]. Changes will not apply retroactively and will only become effective when (i) you use the Services after you are notified about the change, or (ii) thirty days after they are posted (whichever is sooner). However, changes addressing new functions for the Services or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. We will also update the Last Modified Date at the top of these Terms accordingly. Your continued use of the Services after the Last Modified Date signifies your knowledge about and consent to the modified Terms. You are expected to check this page frequently so you are aware of any changes, as they are binding on you. If the modified Terms are not acceptable to you, you should not access or use the Services after the Last Modified Date. We shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of the Service. </p>

<h2>10. Data Privacy and Personal Information</h2>

<p>Friendster is a U.S.-based company. Regardless of where you use our Services or provide information to us, including your Personal Information as defined in our Privacy Policy, the information may be transferred to and maintained on servers located inside and outside the U.S., including to countries outside the European Economic Area (âEEAâ). By using our Services you acknowledge, agree and consent to the transfer and processing of your information both inside and outside of the U.S. and in accordance with the Privacy Policy and U.S. law. </p><p>

No information transmitted over the Internet can be guaranteed to be secure. We cannot guarantee the security of any Information that you transmit to us, or receive from us. Although we take measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that Information that we collect and that you give us will not be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy. You assume all such risks with regards to your use of the Services. You understand that information you provide to us in connection with the Services may be transferred unencrypted and involve (a) transmissions over various networks; and (b) changes to conform and adapt to technical requirements of connecting networks or devices. </p>

<h2>11. Third Party Materials</h2>
<p>The Services may link to independent third-party websites, applications or social media widgets. We are not liable for the availability or accuracy of such third-party sources, and you assume all risk in using them. When you link to them, these third-party sites or services may place cookies and other tracking technologies on your computer and may have different rules for using or sharing any personal information you submit to them. We encourage you to read their privacy policies before submitting your personal information. When you access third-party websites or interact or communicate with third parties, including other users, through the Services, you do so at your own risk. We are not responsible for the actions, content, information, data, practices, policies or opinions of any third parties, including other users. You are solely responsible for your interactions with other users, and any other parties with whom you interact through the Services. You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any online or offline interaction with any other person.</p>

<p>If you have a dispute with one or more third parties, including other users, you release us (and our officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, joint ventures and employees) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes, including damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, privacy or data. We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to become involved in any way with these disputes. If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code Â§1542, which says: âA general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.â And, if you are not a California resident, you waive any applicable state statutes of a similar effect.</p><p>
In addition to the Services, the Website may also advertise, offer, or make available information, products and/or services provided by third parties (collectively, the â<b>Third-Party Materials</b>â). Third-party products and/or services are governed by separate agreements or licenses with the third parties. We offer no guarantees and assumes no responsibility or liability of any type with respect to the Third-Party Materials, including any liability resulting from incompatibility between third-party products and/or services and the products and/or services provided by us. You agree that you will not hold us responsible or liable with respect to the Third-Party Materials or seek to do so.</p>


<h2>12. Payments</h2>
<p>The Services are currently provided free of charge.</p>
<p>All of the Services, including availability and price, are subject to change at any time without notice. We reserve the right, with or without prior notice, to charge a fee for the Services, to limit the availability of or to discontinue any Service; to impose conditions on any promotion; to bar any user from making any payment; and/or to refuse to provide any user with any Service.</p>

<h2>13. Licenses Granted</h2>
<p>We grant to you a revocable, non-transferable, nonexclusive, limited and non-assignable license to access and use the Services in accordance with these Terms. We reserve all other rights in the Services not expressly granted to you.</p>

<h2>14. User Submissions</h2>
<p>We do not accept unsolicited suggestions and/or ideas. All inquiries, feedback, suggestions, ideas, criticism or other information that you provide to us concerning the Services (collectively, â<b>Submissions</b>â) will be treated as non-proprietary and non-confidential. By transmitting or posting any Submission, you hereby grant us full ownership of the Submission as if we had created, developed and posted the Submission for its own purposes, with no obligation to pay you royalties or any other compensation. Please note this is different from User Submitted Content, which is addressed above. We reserve the right to copy, use, reproduce, modify, adapt, translate, publish, license, distribute, sell or assign the Submission in any way as it sees fit, including but not limited to copying in whole or in part, creating derivative works from, distributing and displaying any Submission in any form, media, or technology, whether now known or hereafter developed, alone or as part of other works, or using the Submission within or in connection with our products or Services.

The disclaimer of warranties, limitation of liability, jurisdictional, limitation of time to file claims, indemnification and arbitration provisions survive any termination.</p>

<h2>17. Indemnification</h2>
<p>You are solely legally liable if your use or misuse of the Services, any associated content, or any products and/or services delivered to you through the site causes damage to the Services, to you, or to someone or something else. You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless us, our affiliates, licensors and service providers, and our respective employees, contractors, officers, directors and agents from and against all liabilities, claims, damages, judgment, awards, losses, costs, expenses, fines or fees (including attorney's fees and investigation costs), that arise from or relate to your use or misuse of the Services, or violation of these Terms or violation of a third partyâs rights. We reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will cooperate with us in asserting any available defenses.</p>

<h2>18. Limitation on Time to File Claims</h2>
<p>Any cause of action or claim you may have arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services must be commenced within one (1) year after the cause of action accrues, otherwise, such cause of action is permanently barred.</p>

<h2>19. Choice of Law</h2>
<p>You agree that the laws of the State of Delaware and U.S. federal law govern these Terms, your use of the Services, and any claim or dispute that you may have against us, without regard to New Yorkâs conflict of laws rules. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to this Agreement.</p>

<h2>20. Binding Arbitration and Jurisdiction</h2>
<p>In the rare event you have a dispute with us, we encourage you to contact us immediately so we can work together toward a satisfactory resolution. If we cannot come to a resolution, you agree that any claims, disputes, demands, counts, controversies, or causes of action between you and us arising out of or relating to these Terms, the Services, including the enforceability of these Terms or our Privacy Policy or information practices will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis only (except as stated below). The arbitrator may not consolidate more than one personâs claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding, unless we provide express prior written consent.</p><p>
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO HAVE YOUR CLAIMS HEARD IN COURT BY A JUDGE OR JURY. AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS AS ENFORCEABLE AS A COURT ORDER AND IS SUBJECT TO ONLY LIMITED REVIEW BY A JUDGE. YOU ALSO UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION PREVENTS YOU FROM PARTICIPATING AS A PLAINTIFF OR AS A CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</p><p>
Arbitration will be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act, and shall be commenced and conducted by the American Arbitration Association (â<b>AAA</b>â) under the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes, as amended by this provision, by one arbitrator that is acceptable to both parties. You can find out more about AAA and how to file an arbitration claim at www.adr.org or by calling 800-778-7879.</p><p>
Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. In the event you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. In such case, we will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to the AAA. If the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration are frivolous, you agree to reimburse us for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by us on your behalf, which you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAAâs rules.</p><p>
The arbitration will be conducted through written submission, unless the arbitrator determines that a telephonic hearing is required. Except as otherwise provided in these Terms, you and we may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator. In the event this arbitration provision is held unenforceable by a court, or in the event AAA refuses to arbitrate the dispute, all controversies, disputes, demands, counts, claims, or causes of action between you and us shall be exclusively brought in the state or federal courts of Delaware.</p>

<h2>21. Severability and Integration</h2>
<p>These Terms and any supplemental terms, policies, rules and guidelines posted on the Services constitute the entire agreement between you and us. If any part of the Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be construed in a manner consistent with applicable law to reflect, as nearly as possible, the original intentions of the parties, and the remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect. The paragraph headings used herein are for convenience only and shall not be used to limit any portion of these Terms of Service.</p>

<h2>22. General Provisions</h2>
<p>You may not assign these Terms without our prior written approval. We may assign these Terms without your consent to: (i) a subsidiary or affiliate; (ii) an acquirer of our business or assets; or (iii) a successor by merger. Any purported assignment in violation of this section shall be void. No joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and us as a result of these Terms or your use of the Services. Our failure to enforce any right or provision in these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision unless acknowledged and agreed to by us in writing.</p>
