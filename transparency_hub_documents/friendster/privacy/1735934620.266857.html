We may use cookies to provide certain features of the Services. It may be possible to refuse to accept cookies by activating the appropriate setting on your device. However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain features of the Services. We may also use other technologies to tailor the Services to you, such as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags and single-pixel gifs) that permit Friendster, for example, to track how visitors interact with the Services and for other statistics related to the Services (such as recording the popularity of certain content and verifying system and server integrity).</li>

<li>Log Information.

<li>Device Identifiers. We may collect information about your device, such as your operating system, hardware version, device settings, file and software names and types, mobile network information and device identifiers.

<li>Analytics Data. We may also collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Services.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>C.   Information Collected from Third-Party Companies.</b> In the Services you may find links to third-party websites. You understand that when you click on these links any data which you provide afterwards is subject to that third partyâs privacy policy and not to Friendsterâs. Consequently, Friendster takes no responsibility for the content, safety or security of any third-party website and recommends you consult these third partiesâ policies before sending Personal Information to their websites. </p><p>
You may choose not to give us your information including your Personal Information. However, without your information, we may not be able to provide you with the Services or respond to your questions.

You may also send us an email at help@friendster.com to request access to, correct or delete any Personal Information that you have provided to us.

<h2>8. How We Store, Transfer and Retain Your Personal Information. </h2>
<p>Friendster is a U.S.-based company. Regardless of where you use our Services or provide information to us, the information may be transferred to and maintained on servers located inside and outside the U.S., including to countries outside the European Economic Area (âEEAâ). By using our Services you acknowledge, agree and consent to your information, including your Personal Information, being processed outside your jurisdiction, including in countries and jurisdictions that may not provide the same level of protection. Such transfers will only take place for the specific purposes mentioned in this Privacy Policy.</p><p> 
Friendster retains your Personal Information only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. You can ask us to delete your Personal Information at any time by contacting us. We will delete all Personal Information including all User Submitted Content associated with you within two weeks of receiving your request.  </p><p>
Friendster shall not be liable to the User or any person for the deletion or failure to store any Personal Information including User Submitted Content arising from the account holderâs decision to terminate their account or otherwise. This includes Friendsterâs right to delete User Submitted Content that violates our Terms of Service.</p>

<h2>9. Data Security.</h2>
<p>We have implemented measures designed to secure your Personal Information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration and disclosure. All Personal Information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers behind firewalls. Any Personal Information you provide to us through your use of the Services will be encrypted using industry standard technology. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information, including Personal Information, that you transmit to Friendster or guarantee that your information on the Services may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by a breach of any of our physical, managerial, or technical safeguards.
</p><p>The safety and security of your Personal Information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to the Services, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone.
</p><p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure.  Although we do our best to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee the security of your Personal Information transmitted through the Services. Any transmission of Personal Information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures we provide.</p>
